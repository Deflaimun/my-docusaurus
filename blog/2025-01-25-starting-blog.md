After 3 incredible years contracting at Redpanda Data through Stack Builders, I’m excited to explore new opportunities in Full-Stack Development or Documentation Engineering.

I've loved my work at Redpanda as a doc engineer, where I could improve user experiences and simplify our docs-as-code environment. Check out our work here: [Redpanda Documentation](https://docs.redpanda.com/).

Thank you Redpanda and Stackbuilders, and a special thank you to my teammates: Joyce Fee, Michele Cyran, Jake Cahill, 📝 Kat Batuigas, and Angela Simms. Working alongside you has been a privilege.

If you know of any openings or are hiring for similar roles, I’d love to connect!
